Unemployment Rates in the UK: Examining the Roles of Gender Unemployment Rate Gap, Post-Brexit Trends, Energy Consumption, and GDP
Unemployment occurs when there is an imbalance between the demand for labour and its supply (Baussola & Mussida, 2011). Recent labour market trends reveal a rise in mismatches, with high unemployment rates coexisting alongside significant job vacancies, a pattern particularly evident in the US and notable within the European Union (Baussola & Mussida, 2011). This report examines the impact of the gender unemployment rate gap, post-Brexit trends, energy consumption, and GDP on unemployment rates in the UK. These factors were chosen for their significance in shaping labour market dynamics during periods of economic and political change. The gender gap highlights employment inequalities (Leoncini et al., 2024), while Brexit has disrupted migration and regional labour markets (Lenoël et al., 2020). Energy consumption drives industrial productivity and employment opportunities (Lorusso & Pieroni, 2018), and GDP serves as a key indicator of job creation (Heimberger, 2021). This research aims to expand existing literature by exploring the interplay of these factors and providing actionable insights to mitigate unemployment disparities.
To investigate the relationship between the unemployment rate and the unemployment gender gap, we obtained data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The unemployment gender gap is defined as the difference between the female and male unemployment rates. To further examine the influence of GDP and energy consumption on the UK's unemployment rate, we sourced additional data from both the ONS (https://www.ons.gov.uk/) and data.gov.uk (https://www.data.gov.uk/). As appropriate data on immigration was unavailable from these sources, we introduced a dummy variable to capture the timeline distinction between pre- and post-Brexit, reflecting the policy impact on immigration. Although Brexit officially occurred in 2020, its effects began in 2016. Accordingly, we assigned a value of 1 to data from 2017 onward and a value of 0 to data from 2016 and earlier.
Simple Linear Regression: The regression analysis revealed that GENDERGAP has a statistically significant negative relationship with unemployment (coefficient = -1.3168, t = -10.95, p < 0.001), indicating that as the gender gap increases, unemployment decreases. It indicates that when male unemployment rates rise compared to female unemployment rates, the overall unemployment rate in the UK tends to increase. Similarly, LOGGDP shows a significant negative relationship (coefficient = -1.9937, t = -4.393, p < 0.001), highlighting GDP’s role in reducing unemployment, which is consistent with literature linking higher GDP to more job opportunities. In contrast, ENERGY (coefficient = 6.963e-06, t = 0.481, p = 0.6314) and GROWTHRATE (coefficient = 0.05241, t = 0.754, p = 0.453) were not significant predictors of unemployment rate in the UK. An additional analysis (Summary 5) examined GDP growth, with a t-value of 0.754, showing it is a weaker predictor compared to log (GDP). This underscores that the economy's overall size has a more direct influence on unemployment than short-term growth fluctuations. These findings emphasize the importance of focusing on structural variables like the gender gap and long-term economic trends in unemployment analysis, as they provide more significant insights for addressing labour market disparities.
Adding the Brexit dummy variable set as 1 from 2017 onward, if we use an 80%:20% train:test split, the data is insufficient. Therefore, we adapted a 90/10 split to perform multivariate regression, though this approach still resulted in a small test dataset.
Multiple Linear Regression: The R-squared value is 0.7336, and the adjusted R-squared is 0.7256. This means that approximately 73.36% of the variability in the unemployment rate is explained by the model, and after accounting for model complexity, about 72.56% of the variance in unemployment rate is explained. The model fits the data well.
Key Findings: The unemployment gender gap (female unemployment rate minus male unemployment rate) has a negative relationship with the unemployment rate. GDP itself negatively influences unemployment while it positively influences unemployment under the consideration of unemployment gender gap. Energy consumption has a limited impact on unemployment rate in the UK. Lastly, the unemployment rate is lower post-Brexit than pre-Brexit.
